              <strong>How was the average response time by call priority calculated?</strong> The average response time
              is calculated by filtering calls for service received by the Hazel Crest Police Department in person, by
              911, or by telephone that required a police response. The time each incident&apos;s first responding
              officer arrives on scene is determined, then subtracted from the time the call was originally logged. This
              difference gives the response time for each incident. The average response time by call priority is then
              obtained by grouping by call priority and calculating the median of these individual response times across
              all incidents.
            </Typography>

            <Typography paragraph>
              <strong>How was the average time on scene by call priority calculated?</strong> The average time on scene
              is calculated by taking the time logged by officers when they arrive on scene and subtracting that from
              the time they mark themselves off the scene. The average time on scene by call priority is then obtained
              by grouping by call priority and calculating the median of the time on scene across incidents.

            <Typography paragraph>
              <strong>How was the average time on scene by call type calculated?</strong> The average time on scene is
              calculated by taking the time logged by officers when they arrive on scene and subtracting that from the
              time they mark themselves off the scene. The average time on scene by call type is then obtained by
              grouping by call type and calculating the median of the time on scene across incidents.
            </Typography>

            <Typography paragraph>
              <strong>How were the call type categories created?</strong> The time on scene is calculated based on the
              time logged by officers when they arrive on scene and when they mark themselves off the scene. This total
              time is then divided by the number of incidents in a given year to display the average.
